# Binary-Visitor-Counter
The project appointed to us is Bidirectional visitor counter and in this project, we have added the visitor counter display LCD , which will display the total number visitors in the room.

•	In the first part of this project we have used various IC and components to make the most efficient and most power friendly circuit.

•	In the second part of this project we have used Arduino and implemented the visitor counter display LCD with using less components and a more user friendly way and to take it on another level we have added relay circuit which can be used to light any room in presence of person in room and light will automatically go down in absence of person thus reducing power consumption .
This project has not only helped us with understanding some basic electronic fundamental and Arduino properties but also how to establish a real life project and the complications we face in it.
